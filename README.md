# ES6-SEED

AngularJS boilerplate for ES6 and Karma/Jasmine unit tests


```
npm install
karma start
gulp
npm start
```


Do not **expect** a great html template, lets focus on the very **basic** structuring for ES6 and unit testing. Also, this boilerplate does not intend to cover the complete reference, but only **to be** the first tiny step. Keep in mind that only the experience and hard work will guide you to the **true** learning.
